a tool that provides an overview of clocked hours and pay rates for employees. \r\n                            It includes various functions such as clocking in/out, tracking time worked, and calculating wages based on different pay rates. \r\n                            The dashboard displays key information such as start/end times, location, total hours worked, employee name, date, and day of the week. \r\n                            Additionally, it allows for the customization of pay rates, including 100%, 110%, 120%, 135%, 150%, and 200%, as well as an extra field for special cases. \r\n                            The tool also includes the ability to edit and delete clocked hours. \r\n                            Overall, the salary dashboard provides an efficient and comprehensive solution for managing employee hours and compensation.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <a href=\"https://github.com/MustafaAltun2/garage-overzicht\"

nowadays cannot leave their laptop or phone behind.\r\n                            This is what makes people so vulnerable against hackers.\r\n                            Hackers could hack your

                      There are also gameconsoles and sensors and other cool widgets that can be hacked into.\r\n                            Like smartwatches or smartglasses, they could reveal your

          Leaders and managers within the IT field are responsible for ensuring that both the physical hardware and software networks and resources are working optimally.\r\n                            IT infrastructure can be looked at as the foundation of an organization's technology systems, thereby playing an integral part in driving its success.\r\n                            All organizations who rely on technology to do their business can benefit from having a robust, interconnected IT Infrastructure.\r\n                            With the current speed that technology changes and the competitive nature of businesses, IT leaders have to ensure that their IT Infrastructure is designed such that changes can be made quickly and without impacting the business continuity.\r\n                            While traditionally companies used to typically rely on physical data centers or colocation facilities to support their IT Infrastructure, cloud hosting has become more popular as it is easier to manage and scale.\r\n                            IT Infrastructure can be managed by the company themselves or it can be outsourced to another company who has consulting expertise to develop robust infrastructures for an organization.\r\n                            With advances in online outreach availability, it has become easier for end users to access technology.\r\n                            As a result, IT infrastructures have become more complex and therefore, it is harder for managers to oversee the end to end operations.\r\n                            In order to mitigate this issue, strong IT Infrastructures require employees with varying skill sets.\r\n                            The fields of IT management and IT service management rely on IT infrastructure, and the ITIL framework was developed as a set of best practices with regard to IT infrastructure.\r\n                            The ITIL framework assists companies with the ability to be responsive to technological market demands.\r\n                            Technology can often be thought of as an innovative product which can incur high production costs. However, the ITIL framework helps address these issues and allows the company to be more cost effective which helps IT managers to keep the IT Infrastructure functioning.\r\n                          </p>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                  </div>\r\n              </section>\r\n              <section className=\"My-Work Reserve\">\r\n                  <div className = \"Text-box color3\">\r\n                      <div className=\"Text-Box-Content\">\r\n                          <h3>Security Domains </h3>\r\n                          <h4 className = \"White\">school optional subject</h4>\r\n                          <p className = \"White\">\r\n                            A security domain is the determining factor in the classification of an enclave of servers/computers.\r\n                            A network with a different security domain is kept separate from other networks.
