                <h3>Hi, I am Mustafa</h3>
                <p>
                    I am a programming student, I am always eager to learn a new language
                     or improve code visibility for people new in the project group/team. 
                     Over the years I have learned quite a bit about programming.
                     I have a solid 2+ years of extensive experience in HTML5, CSS3, javascript, bootstrap 3,
                    SASS/SCSS, react and wordpress also basic python. I am specialized in CSS3 with a keen attention
                    to design. Currently learning C# and python(GDscript).<br/><br/>
                    I believe every obstacle can be overcome through sheer commitment and hard work. Always up for learning new things. 
                </p>
