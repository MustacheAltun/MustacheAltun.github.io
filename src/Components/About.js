                <p>
                As a programming student, I am constantly driven to expand my knowledge and improve the codebase for new members of my project team. 
                Through my years of experience, I have gained proficiency in a range of programming languages including C#, Python, React, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, as well as various content management systems. 
                With over 5 years of extensive experience in these fields, I am confident in my ability to deliver quality code and contribute effectively to any project.
                <br/><br/>I believe every obstacle can be overcome through sheer commitment and hard work. Always up for learning new things. 
                </p>
